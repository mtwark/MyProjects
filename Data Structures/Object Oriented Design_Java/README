Notes:
_______________
Program should work with all pieces, including pawns. Also wrote a method
that displays, on an 8x8 board, the possible paths any given piece can take.
I plan to go back and clean up the pawns updatePaths function eventually.
I also realize that a lot of the program isn't organized in the best manner
in terms of readability. Will go back and make small changes for readability
during the [probably] next chess assignment.
